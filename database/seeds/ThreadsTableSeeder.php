             Creativity is the base of success. In our existence there has always only been one purpose and that purpose is creation.

             If our ultimate purpose is to reproduce than the act of reproduction is creation as well.
             Today more than ever we need a guid to pick us up to leave the path of slavery.

             Creativity comes from your intuition. Some people call this the infinite intelligence.
             It will only speak to you when the mind is quiet.
